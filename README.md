## What this explores
- Congestion under pressure
- Spontaneous alignment
- Ordered flow without global control

## Visual semantics
### Visual cues are not decorative; they expose internal system states:
- Red halos indicate individual pressure from local crowd density  
- Directional ticks show local directional agreement (order)  
- Color and radius encode speed and neighborhood density

## Controls
- Left click – apply local repulsion force
- Passive mouse presence influences nearby agents


Rather than scripting behavior, the system observes and visualizes how order and stress emerge from local interactions.
This project is intentionally minimal and exploratory, designed as a visual thinking tool rather than a finished product.
